typescript + mocha + babel boilerplate
--------------------------------------

Good for:
 - migration from es2015 js code to typescript
 - ts + mocha fresh start if you plan to use old js code
 
 Supports both ts and js. Allows mixed imports: js from ts, ts from js.
 
 Absolute path imports starting with 'src/', see sample code.
 
 Express and heroku support added out of the box.

 If you want to use react, please add jsx, tsx extensions manually.
 
 `npm run watch` for debug
 
 `npm run once` for single start, no js build
 
 `npm run test` for mocha tests
 
 `npm run build` to build js version
 
 
 Delete yarn.lock if you want fresh versions of packages.
